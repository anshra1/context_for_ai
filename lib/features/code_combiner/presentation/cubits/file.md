● Understanding the Directory Tree Screen

  Based on the Code Combiner feature analysis, here's what I
  understand about the Directory Tree Screen:

  🎯 Primary Purpose:

  The Directory Tree Screen is where users browse, select, and manage 
  files for combining/exporting. It's the core workspace where users
  interact with their project files.

  📊 Screen Components:

  1. File Tree View - Hierarchical display of directories and files
  2. Selection Controls - Checkboxes for selecting files/folders
  3. Filter Controls - Apply file type/size filters
  4. Action Buttons - Export, preview, clear selections
  5. Status Bar - Show selected count, estimated tokens, file sizes

  🔄 User Workflow:

  User opens directory → See file tree → Select files → Apply filters
  → Export combined files
