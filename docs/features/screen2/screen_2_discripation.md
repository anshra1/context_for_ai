Here’s your second screen lifecycle rewritten in clean, professional bullet-point format, preserving all detail but improving structure for clarity and actionability:
🔹 1. Screen Initialization
Receives a folder path from the first screen.
Opens that folder directly from disk.

Parses:
All folders.
All non-binary, readable files.
Builds an in-memory tree structure.

list UI
Expandable chevrons.
Checkboxes.
Filter pills (chips).
🔹 2. Initial UI Elements
Scrollable tree view (dark theme).

Top-right token counter
Live estimate of selected content.

Filter pills.dart.yaml
Instantly toggle visibility of matching file types.
(Optional) Search bar – currently omitted.

Bottom action buttons
Open Preview
Copy to Clipboard
Save as .txt
🔹 3. User Interactions & Behaviors

Toggling a checkbox
Selects or deselects a file/folder.
Updates the token counter.
If unreadable or binary → show toast: “Skipped unreadable file(s)”.

Toggling a filter pill
Instantly re-renders visible list.
Existing selections (even if now hidden) are retained.

Tapping "Save as .txt"
Concatenates selected file contents.
Saves the result to a user-chosen location on disk.
Shows toast on success or failure.

Tapping "Copy to Clipboard"
Concatenates selected content.
Copies it to the system clipboard.
Shows toast on success or failure.

Tapping "Open Preview"
Navigates to a full-screen preview page.
Passes in-memory concatenated selection.
Preview is read-only.
🔹 4. Error Handling (via Toasts Only)
📂 Can’t open folder →“Permission denied / folder can’t be read.”
📄 Can’t read a selected file →Silently skipped + toast: “Skipped unreadable file(s).”
❌ Save or clipboard operation fails →Clear failure toast.
🔹 5. Cleanup on Exit

home screen
In-memory tree and all selections are discarded.
Only exported file (if saved) remains.
Let me know if you want this converted into a flowchart format (Mermaid, Figma-style logic, or sequence diagram) or mapped to Clean Architecture layers.
